Progress notifications + idle tasks:
    File ops use their own timers for some reason, even though
    NautilusProgressInfo has a perfectly usable one. No need to be anal
    about shaving off milliseconds (the preparation). Although,
    having two timers would allow to have exactly what is needed -
    the progress info timer could be started so that the widget appears
    in the popover, but that seems needlessly wasteful.

    Status??????????????? A possible hack is signaling a task from the
    manager so that file tasks can set up the status for waiting, but
    the signal doesn’t yet seem to be useful outside file tasks.
    Crazy idea: redo the progress widgets so that they always show
    the file(s) on which tasks are being performed. Something like:
        Foo.bar
        [small, dim text] Duplicating…
        (======================>  )
        33 MiB/44 MiB - 3 hours remaining (1 KiB/s)
    That would lighten the load on tasks/operations/whatchamacallits when
    creating progress strings.
    The downside is wasting some vertical space, but that might look better
    in the end.

    A good thing would be minimizing the degree of separation between
    tasks and progress info (and their managers), but a problem to solve would
    be the viewer stuff in the progress info manager.

    Not doing anything about all this for now.
