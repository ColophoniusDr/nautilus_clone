            Hi,

            Thank you for raising an issue to help improve Nautilus. We're sorry this particular issue has gone unnoticed for quite some time.

            This issue will be closed, as it meets the following criteria:
            * No activity in the past 18 months (3 releases).
            * Unscheduled. Not associated with a milestone or with ~"2. Deliverable" or ~"2. Stretch" project planning labels.

            We'd like to ask you to help us keep our issue tracker organized  by determining whether this issue should be reopened.

            If this issue is reporting a bug, let us know if this issue is still present in a newer version and if you can reproduce it in the [nightly version](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Nightly).

            Thanks for your help!
